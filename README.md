# Federated-Learning-for-Enhanced-Classification-of-Covid-Pneumonia-and-Normal-Lung-X-Ray-Images


The ongoing global health crisis underscored by the COVID-19 pandemic has intensified the need for advanced diagnostic tools that are both efficient and privacy-preserving. This study investigates the application of federated learning (FL) to classify lung X-ray images into COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal categories. We developed a federated network that aggregates learning models trained on an open Kaggle dataset divided into four distinct partitions. Each partition was securely distributed to separate devices to simulate real world applications of this technique wherein sharing of data across devices is not only costly but can potentially violate patient privacy law. Utilizing ResNet-50, a convolutional neural network (CNN), as a base model in a federated approach ensures data privacy and accesses diverse data features.
